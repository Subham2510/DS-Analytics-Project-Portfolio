# Cancer Cell Classification Model

## Motive
This project aims to build a robust cancer cell classification model using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and explore various aspects of data analysis and visualization. The primary goal is to develop an accurate predictive model for classifying cancer cells as malignant or benign based on key features.

## Data Origin
The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer dataset, containing features derived from cell nuclei characteristics. The dataset is sourced from [Data Source Link], providing a reliable foundation for cancer classification research.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Project Overview

### 1. Data Exploration and Visualization
- Histograms and density plots for mean, error, and worst variables.
- Correlation matrix heatmap for feature relationships.
- Pair plots for a visual representation of feature distributions.

### 2. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
- Label encoding and normalization of data.
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.

### 3. SVM Classification
- Utilization of Support Vector Machines for cancer cell classification.
- Evaluation metrics include accuracy scores, cross-validation, ROC curves, and confusion matrices.

### 4. Hyperparameter Tuning with Grid Search
- Optimizing the SVM model through grid search for the best hyperparameters.

### 5. Decision Boundary Visualization
- Visual representation of decision boundaries for SVM classifiers.

## Usage
1. Install required libraries: `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn`
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file: `Cancer_Classification_SVM.ipynb`
3. Follow step-by-step instructions for data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## Conclusion
This project provides insights into cancer cell classification using SVM, offering a comprehensive overview of data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation. The findings aim to contribute to cancer research and provide a foundation for further improvements in predictive modeling.
