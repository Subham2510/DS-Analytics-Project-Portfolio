# Custom Capitalization-Weighted Index for Oil & Gas Sector of USA 

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project stems from the economic significance and financial resilience of the Oil & Gas sector in the USA. By creating a custom Capitalization-Weighted Index, I aim to provide investors with a comprehensive benchmark for tracking the performance of the top oil and gas companies, reflecting the sector's contribution to the economy and its investment potential.

## Business Problem
The primary business problem addressed by this project is the lack of a tailored index that accurately represents the performance of the Oil & Gas sector in the USA. Existing indices may not capture the nuances of this specific industry, leading to suboptimal investment decisions for stakeholders seeking exposure to this sector.

## Data Origin
Data for constructing the index was sourced from finance.yahoo.com and companiesmarketcap.com. Market capitalization figures, provided in billions, were collected for the USA's top 10 oil and gas companies. This data spans seven years, from 2016 to 2022, enabling a comprehensive analysis of historical performance and trends.

## Requirements
- Access to finance.yahoo.com and companiesmarketcap.com for data collection
- Google Sheets for organizing and analyzing the collected data ([link_to_google_sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eBIVOjuR5DE0ET9Uq1hY8y3MTrIl4-jCEhmjCAlGqUE/edit?usp=sharing))
- Basic knowledge of financial metrics and index construction principles

## Concepts Used
### Capitalization-Weighted Index:
A Capitalization Weighted Index assigns weights to each component based on its market capitalization, giving larger companies more influence over the index's performance. This approach reflects the market's valuation of each company and provides a representative measure of the sector's overall performance.

### Alternative Indices:
Alternative index weighting methodologies include equal-weighted, price-weighted, and fundamental-weighted indices. While each approach has its merits, a Capitalization-Weighted Index is widely used due to its simplicity and alignment with market dynamics.
