# Understanding Customer Preferences in a DVD Rental Company
Using MySQL | By Subham Pramanick

## Introduction: 

The world of entertainment is constantly evolving, and the DVD rental industry is no exception. To stay ahead of the curve, companies need to understand their customers' preferences and tailor their offerings accordingly. This project delves into the fascinating world of customer behavior within a DVD rental company, aiming to unlock valuable insights that can drive marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

## Business Problem: Optimizing Recommendations and Targeting Strategies

This project tackles a crucial business problem faced by the DVD rental company: **how to effectively recommend films to customers and optimize marketing campaigns for maximum impact.** By analyzing customer rental data, we aim to answer key questions such as:

* What are the most popular film genres and actor preferences among customers?
* How can we personalize recommendations based on individual viewing habits?
* Which customer segments are most receptive to targeted marketing campaigns?
* What are the most effective combinations of film categories to promote together?

By addressing these questions, we can provide the company with actionable insights to:

* Enhance customer engagement by recommending films that resonate with their preferences.
* Develop targeted marketing campaigns that reach the right audience with the right message.
* Optimize resource allocation and maximize the return on marketing investments.

This project will not only benefit the company but also empower customers to discover hidden gems and enjoy a more personalized movie-watching experience.

# 1. Data Exploration

## 1.1 Rental table

The first table in our database schema is the rental table. Let's take a look at all the columns in the table. We'll limit the output to 10 rows.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM dvd_rentals.rental
LIMIT 10;
```

*Output:*

| rental_id | rental_date              | inventory_id | customer_id | return_date              | staff_id | last_update              |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------------|-------------|--------------------------|----------|--------------------------|

So, the rental table contains all the details of the films that were rented along with other details such as ```inventory_id```, ```customer_id``` along with ```rental & return date```. So, one customer can rent multiple films from different inventories for an amount of time. Let's explore this table more.

```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) 
FROM dvd_rentals.rental;
```

*Output:*

| count |
|-------|
| 16044 |

Let's see all the records for one customer.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM dvd_rentals.rental
WHERE customer_id = 5
LIMIT 5;
```

*Output:*

| rental_id | rental_date              | inventory_id | customer_id | return_date              | staff_id | last_update              |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------------|-------------|--------------------------|----------|--------------------------|
| 731       | 2005-05-29T07:25:16.000Z | 4124         | 5           | 2005-05-30T05:21:16.000Z | 1        | 2006-02-15T21:30:53.000Z |

| 1142      | 2005-05-31T19:46:38.000Z | 3998         | 5           | 2005-06-05T14:03:38.000Z | 1        | 2006-02-15T21:30:53.000Z |
| 1502      | 2005-06-15T22:03:14.000Z | 3277         | 5           | 2005-06-23T18:42:14.000Z | 2        | 2006-02-15T21:30:53.000Z |
| 1631      | 2005-06-16T08:01:02.000Z | 2466         | 5           | 2005-06-19T09:04:02.000Z | 1        | 2006-02-15T21:30:53.000Z |

## 1.2 Inventory table

The inventory table consists of all the records of avalaible film copies and the store which they belong to.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM dvd_rentals.inventory
LIMIT 10;
```

*Output:*

| inventory_id | film_id | store_id | last_update              |
|--------------|---------|----------|--------------------------|
| 1            | 1       | 1        | 2006-02-15T05:09:17.000Z |
| 2            | 1       | 1        | 2006-02-15T05:09:17.000Z |

| 6            | 1       | 2        | 2006-02-15T05:09:17.000Z |
| 7            | 1       | 2        | 2006-02-15T05:09:17.000Z |
| 8            | 1       | 2        | 2006-02-15T05:09:17.000Z |
| 9            | 2       | 2        | 2006-02-15T05:09:17.000Z |
| 10           | 2       | 2        | 2006-02-15T05:09:17.000Z |

One film can have multiple copies across store. Let's take a look at total number of inventories.

```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*)
FROM dvd_rentals.inventory;
```

*Output:*

| count |
|-------|
| 4581  |

Also, let's take a look at inventory records for one particular ```film_id```.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM dvd_rentals.inventory
WHERE film_id = 10;
```

*Output:*

| inventory_id | film_id | store_id | last_update              |
|--------------|---------|----------|--------------------------|
| 46           | 10      | 1        | 2006-02-15T05:09:17.000Z |

Let's also take a look at the total number of unique film id we got in the table.

```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT film_id)
FROM dvd_rentals.film;
```

*Output:*

| count |
|-------|
| 1000  |

So, in total there are 1000 unique films in our ```film``` table.

## 1.4 Film_category table

The film category table maps each film to a ```category_id``` it belongs too.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM dvd_rentals.film_category
LIMIT 10;
```

| film_id | category_id | last_update              |
|---------|-------------|--------------------------|

| 10      | 15          | 2006-02-15T05:07:09.000Z |

## 1.5 Category table

This table maps each category_id to its ```name```.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM dvd_rentals.category
LIMIT 10;
```

*Output:*

| category_id | name        | last_update              |

Let's see how many categories we have in total.

```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT category_id)
FROM dvd_rentals.category;
```

*Output:*

| count |
|-------|
|  16   |

## 1.6 Film_actor table

This table links a particular ```film_id``` to multiple ```actors``` as there can be multiple actors working in a film as well as an actor working in multiple films and it shows a many-to-many relationship.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM dvd_rentals.film_actor
WHERE actor_id = 45
LIMIT 5;
```

*Output:*

| actor_id | film_id | last_update              |
|----------|---------|--------------------------|
| 45       | 18      | 2006-02-15T05:05:03.000Z |

## 1.7 Actor table

This is the last table containing the actor details such as name. Let's take a look at the table along with the total number of actors we got.

```sql
SELECT *

Alright, now that we have explored the data a little bit let's move ahead with the analysis.
