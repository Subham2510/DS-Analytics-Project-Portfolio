# Hotel Reviews Analysis Project üè®üìä

## Motive
This project aims to comprehensively analyze hotel reviews, extracting valuable insights to enhance customer experiences. By employing various natural language processing (NLP) techniques, sentiment analysis, emotion analysis, and visualization tools, we seek to understand customer sentiments, identify areas for improvement, and uncover specific aspects contributing to positive experiences.

## Data Origin
The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from diverse hotel reviews, encompassing feedback on various aspects such as amenities, ambiance, and overall guest satisfaction. The data provides a rich source of information to evaluate and improve the hotel's offerings.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x 
- Libraries: pandas, nltk, langdetect, wordcloud, matplotlib, nrclex 

## Concepts Used
1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**
   Utilizing pandas to load and explore the hotel review dataset. 

2. **Language Detection:**
   Employing langdetect to identify and handle reviews in multiple languages. 

3. **Sentiment Analysis:**
   Using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) for sentiment analysis. 

4. **Location Analysis:**
   Analyzing and visualizing the geographical distribution of reviews. 

5. **Tokenization:**
   Employing nltk for tokenizing translated reviews, facilitating further text analysis. 

6. **Word Clouds:**
   Generating word clouds to visually represent frequently used words in positive sentiments. 

7. **Emotion Analysis:**
   Utilizing NRCLex for emotion analysis to understand nuanced emotions behind the reviews. 

## Execution
